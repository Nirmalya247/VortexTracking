3D Flow Around a Confined Square Cylinder
============================================================

This is a 3D time-dependent flow field. The original data set is 440 GB large and lives on a tetrahedral grid. We provide a much smaller version of about 688 MB here that has been resampled onto a uniform grid.

                  approaches are based on a volumetric, particle based, or image based
                  representation of the smoke. This paper introduces an alternative
                  representation of smoke structures: as semi-transparent streak surfaces.
                  In order to make streak surface integration fast enough for interactive
                  applications, we avoid expensive adaptive retriangulations by coupling
                  the opacity of the triangles to their shapes. This way, the surface
                  shows a smoke-like look even in rather turbulent areas. Furthermore,
                  we show modifications of the approach to mimic smoke nozzles, wool
                  tufts, and time surfaces. The technique is applied to a number of
                  test data sets.},

      abstract = {Characteristic curves of vector fields include stream, path, and streak
                  lines. Stream and path lines can be obtained by a simple vector field
                  integration of an autonomous ODE system, i.e., they can be described
                  as tangent curves of a vector field. This facilitates their mathematical
                  analysis including the extraction of core lines around which stream
                  or path lines exhibit swirling motion, or the computation of their
                  curvature for every point in the domain without actually integrating
                  them. Such a description of streak lines is not yet available, which
                  excludes them from most of the feature extraction and analysis tools
                  that have been developed in our community. In this paper, we develop
                  the first description of streak lines as tangent curves of a derived
                  vector field -- the streak line vector field -- and show how it can
                  be computed from the spatial and temporal gradients of the flow map,
                  i.e., a dense path line integration is required. We demonstrate the
                  high accuracy of our approach by comparing it to solutions where
                  the ground truth is analytically known and to solutions where the
                  ground truth has been obtained using the classic streak line computation.
                  Furthermore, we apply a number of feature extraction and analysis
                  tools to the new streak line vector field including the extraction
                  of cores of swirling streak lines and the computation of streak line
                  curvature fields. These first applications foreshadow the large variety
                  of possible future research directions based on our new mathematical
                  description of streak lines.},
